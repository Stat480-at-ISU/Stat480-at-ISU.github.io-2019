## Analysis of NASA Landslide Data

We will be exploring a NASA dataset that has records of landslides after rainfall that occurred from 2007-2016. We are interested in several questions. The first topic we'll investigate is how injuries and fatalities are related to population and landslide length. Then we'll look into what landslide types are most fatal and longest. The same questions will be answered for landslide trigger. Next we will determine how landslide frequency, fatality, length, and trigger vary by time of year. Finally, we'll investigate if there is any seasonal behavior with landslides.
