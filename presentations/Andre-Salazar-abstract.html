## Statistical Evaluation of Influenza Virus Infection and Mortality Rates in the United States for the 5-Year Period 2013-2018

Influenza infection cases are a public health concern that impacts populations on sociological and financial levels. Vaccine effectiveness levels range from 49% to 19% for years 2013 to 2018, respectively. Hospitalization rates for the overall population, all age groups, per 100,000 people were 31.5% for 2013 and 96.1% for 2018. The percentage of deaths due to influenza and influenza-complication related symptoms, pneumonia, are 10.0% for 2013 and 10.8 % for 2018. The objective of this statistical research is to evaluate the relationship among specific age groups and specific influenza virus strains with rates of infection and mortality over the 5-year period 2013 to 2018. Information from United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide data sets for the analysis. R Studio computer software will provide the operating platform for the statistical analysis operations. The proposed outcome and benefits are an increased precision evaluating the effects of annual infection and mortality rates on the United States population for years 2013 to 2018.
