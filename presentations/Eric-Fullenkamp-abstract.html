## What is the relationship between institutional characteristics and institutional outcomes?

For this project, our group will be looking at the relationship between the characteristics of colleges and universities and their outcomes. Institutional characteristics may include standardized test scores, location, cost of attendance, enrollment demographics, and admissions rates, among others. Institutional outcomes may include graduation rates, retention rates, and types of degrees produced, among others. The data will come from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). IPEDS is run by the US federal government and collects data from 7000+ colleges and universities in the US. Institutions are required to complete these surveys every year to receive federal funding.
