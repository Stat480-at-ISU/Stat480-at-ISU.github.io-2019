## Exploring USDA Food Recalls: How to Better "Meat" Product Expectations

The purpose of this project is to investigate recall causation of USDA FSIS inspected foods (beef, poultry including eggs, pork, catfish). As the USDA has a limited budget and number of inspectors, it is important to identify problem areas to focus resources on. Avoiding food recalls saves economically and environmentally, as certain contaminated products must be sterilized and disposed. To investigate this, the USDA FSIS Calendar Year Recall Spreadsheets will be aggregated from 2005-2017 to provide an n of 1095, and a view of recall causality across time. Areas of interest are:

Trends in occurance of different recall reasons (STEC, Listeria, Salmonella, Undeclared Allergen, Extraneous Material, Processing Defect, Undeclared Substance, Residue, Other) across time
Which recall reason creates the most product loss (pound basis)
Which product type creates the most product loss
Trends in "Class" (I, II, III) of recall across time
Determine if certain times of the year are more prone to recall than others

Using provided data, it may be possible to identify areas that federal inspectors should focus on, plant quality control teams should review, extension specialists should generate educational materials on, and USDA research grants should be applied towards.
