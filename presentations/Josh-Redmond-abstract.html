## Spotify's Worldwide Song Ranking analysis 

For our final project, we are going to examine a data set we found on Kaggle that contains Spotify's worldwide daily song rankings from January 2017 to January 2018.  The data set contains the daily ranking of the 200 most listened songs in 53 countries by Spotify users with more than 2 million rows, 6629 artists, 18598 songs, and over 105 billion stream counts.  We are going to examine the data set and try to answer the following questions:

- Whats the top streamed song for the US over the entire year, whats the most streamed song in any one day?

- Which artists have had more than one top ranked song over the year or appeared in the top for more than one country?

- How do the stream counts and song genre's vary between each country, is one type of genre usually more popular?

- How long do songs stay on the top rankings and how long does it take to get to the top?

- Do continents share same top ranking artists or songs, how long does a top ranked song take to get into the ranking of neighboring countries?
