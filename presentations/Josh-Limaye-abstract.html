## Soybean Variety Resistance to Iron Deficiency Chlorosis in Iowa

Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient required for plant photosynthesis, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and other essential metabolic processes in soybean plants. Soybean plant needs to uptake sufficient amounts of iron from the soil to maintain their normal growth and development. Iron is abundant in soil but is not always in the soluble form needed by plants, especially in high pH calcareous soil. Availability of iron to the plant is highly affected by environmental factors such as presence of soluble salts, soil nitrate in the soil, and water-logging (wet soil) conditions. We are interested to investigate the genetic adaptation or resistance of different soybean varieties toward iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) under Iowa temperature, rainfall and soil conditions. We will use IDC data collected from Iowa State University, Agronomy Station. The data were generated from four hundred sixty-four soybean varieties planted with randomized complete block design (RCBD) with two replications in 2014 and four replications in 2015. IDC symptom was rated on visual scale of 1 to 5 (see images below). Visual scoring was made at two to three trifoliate soybean growth stage (IDC_score1), five to six trifoliate (IDC-score_2) and also two weeks later after five to six trifoliate growth stages (IDC_score_3). A scale of 1 indicates no chlorosis and plants were normal green; 2 is plants modest yellowing of upper leaves; 3 are plants with interveinal chlorosis in the upper leaves but no stunting growth; 4 is plants showing interveinal chlorosis with stunting growth; and 5 is plants with sever chlorosis plus stunted growth and necrosis in the new youngest leaves and growing points. We will generate histograms, dot plots, box plots. We will also do simple ANOVA and mean separation analysis to see the variability among 464 soybean varieties and Pearson's linear correlation analysis to determine the correlation between observations at different time-points measured using visual score (IDC_score). Each group members will analyze the IDC data for one of scores (time-points) representing 464 soybean varieties.
