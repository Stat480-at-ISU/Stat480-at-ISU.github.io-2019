## Landing My Dream School

Graduate schools across the globe have seen a rapid increase in the number of applicants to graduate schools. Students pursue a higher education beyond their bachelor's degree for a variety of reasons, including the pursuit of interests on a deeper level, stand out on today's competitive job market, and increase financial prospects. According to (source 1), people with graduate degrees make an average of $8200 per year than others with a bachelor's degree. The goal of this project is to utilize a plethora of categorical and numerical variables that may affect the probability of admissions. Several statistical regression models are constructed to aid prospective students in determining their chance of being admitted into their dream schools.
