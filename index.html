  <h4>Course description:</h4>
  <p>Not all data lives in nice, clean spreadsheets, not all data fits in a computer's main memory. As statisticians we cannot always rely on other people and sciences to get the data into formats that we can deal with: we will discuss aspects of statistical computing as they are relevant for data analysis. Read and work with data in different formats: flat files, databases, web technologies. Elements of literate programming help us with making our workflow transparent and analyses reproducible. We will discuss how to communicate our results in form of R packages and interactive web applications.
