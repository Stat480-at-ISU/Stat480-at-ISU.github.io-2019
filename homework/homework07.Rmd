## Star Wars

1. Download the RMarkdown file with these homework instructions to use as a template for your work.
Make sure to replace "Your Name" in the YAML with your name.
2. We are back to a survey collected by FiveThirtyEight. This time we are interested in a survey on Star Wars - the accompanying article is published [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
starwars <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv")

# the following lines are necessary to make the second line of the file 
# part of the names:
line1 <- names(starwars)
line2 <- unlist(starwars[1,])
varnames <- paste(line1, line2)
# clean up some of the multibyte characters:
names(starwars) <- enc2native(stringi::stri_trans_general(varnames, "latin-ascii"))

starwars <- starwars[-1,]
```

3. How many people respondent to the survey? How many people have seen at least one of the movies? Use the variable `Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? Response` to answer this question. Only consider responses of participants who have seen at least one of the Star Wars films for the remainder of the homework.
4. Variables `Gender Response` and `Age Response` are two of the demographic variables collected. Use `dplyr` to provide a frequency break down for each variable. Does the result surprise you? Comment. Reorder the levels in the variable `Age Response` from youngest to oldest.
5. Variables 10 through 15 answer the question: "Please rank the Star Wars films in order of preference with 1 being your favorite film in the franchise and 6 being your least favorite film." for each of the films. Use `dplyr` to find the average rank for each of the films (Note: you will first have to cast the responses to numbers). Are average ranks different between the mens' and womens' rankings?
On how many responses are the averages based? Show these numbers together with the averages.
6. R2 D2 or C-3P0? Which of these two characters is the more popular one? Use responses to variables 25 and 26 to answer this question. Note: first you need to define  "popularity" based on the available data.  

Due date: the homework is due before class on Thursday. 

For the submission: submit your solution in an R Markdown file and (just for insurance) submit the corresponding html file with it.
